ActsAsSmilable
=================

First one your should to do - install plugin into your rails application. It's very simple, just run:

	ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/dsalahutdinov/acts_as_smilable.git

from root of your rails app.

Now you have method several method available in your rails application:
	1) glyph_smiles method is supported by model (ActiveRecord::Base). It replaces all smiles symbols like ;) with link to smile image
	2) smiles_inserter("comment_raw_body") is supported by ActionView::Base, it renders smiles table and inserts smiles symbol in html input control

Model:

	class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
	  before_save :transform_comment
	  
	  def transform_comment
	    self.body = glyph_smiles(self.body)
	  end
	end

View:
	<% form_for(@comment, :url => comment_post_path(post)) do |f| %>
	    <%= f.text_area :raw_body %>
	    <%= smiles_inserter("comment_body") %><!-- pass your text_area id to smiles_inserter method -->
	    <%= f.submit "Leave Comment" %>
	<% end %>

There are options for smiles_inserter helper:
	1) :count - smiles count to output
	2) :columns - how many columns should contain "smiles table"
	3) :class - CSS class for "smiles table"

Options can be used this way:
	<%= smiles_inserter("comment_raw_body", :class => "smiles-table", :columns => 13, :count => 26) %>

One more thing you should to do - add specific route your routes.rb file before last two routes catched all:
	
	map.connect 'smiles/:id.:format', :controller => "smiles", :action => :show
